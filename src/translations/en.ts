  // About section
  "about.label": "WHY ATH:",
  "about.heroSubtitle": "The revolution in modern tennis training",
  "about.challenges.title": "Modern Tennis Challenges and ATH Solutions",
  "about.challenges.intro": "Contemporary tennis faces several challenges that limit its evolution and accessibility. ATH has developed specific solutions to overcome them.",
  "about.challenge": "The Challenge:",
  "about.solution": "The ATH Solution:",
  "about.challenge1.title": "Limited Access to Expertise",
  "about.challenge1.subtitle": "Challenge #1",
  "about.challenge1.problem": "Only an elite of players has access to high-level programs and coaching. Top coaches' experience is not evenly distributed and it's difficult to follow many athletes without losing quality.",
  "about.challenge1.solution": "To expand access to elite training, ATH uses digital tools that collect data on technique, tactics, physical state, mental approach, plus medical and biochemical parameters. Head coaches can thus provide extremely personalized support, optimizing time and resources for each athlete.",
  "about.challenge2.title": "Teaching Inconsistency",
  "about.challenge2.subtitle": "Challenge #2",
  "about.challenge2.problem": "To compensate for main coaches' limitations, other coaches are trained who create training discontinuity. This generates inconsistency and hinders athlete growth.",
  "about.challenge2.solution": "We use concrete data from tracking systems, video analysis, athletic tests, mental evaluations, and medical parameters. We organize continuous meetings, supported by AI, to adapt training guidelines to each athlete's real needs. This ensures consistent and detailed instructions, as in professional settings, with performance analysis, training personalization, and competitive planning.",
  "about.challenge3.title": "Insufficient Analysis",
  "about.challenge3.subtitle": "Challenge #3",
  "about.challenge3.problem": "A coach, however expert, cannot constantly monitor an athlete unless following them full-time. Their decisions are based on fragmented and reported information, reducing analysis accuracy.",
  "about.challenge3.solution": "Our real-time technology captures every detail, including technical, physical, mental, medical, and biochemical aspects. Coaches receive immediate and certain feedback, promoting continuous and measurable improvements.",
  "about.challenge4.title": "Limited Personalization",
  "about.challenge4.subtitle": "Challenge #4",
  "about.challenge4.problem": "\"Commercial\" solutions often propose a unique method, ignoring individual needs. Those not directly followed by the main coach have few opportunities to personalize their path.",
  "about.challenge4.solution": "With a mix of AI and professional skills, we design tailored training plans. We consider age, physical and mental development, biotype, learning style, goals, and health parameters. This way, the plan evolves with the athlete's progress, both physical and mental.",
  "about.challenge5.title": "Fragmented Development",
  "about.challenge5.subtitle": "Challenge #5",
  "about.challenge5.problem": "Technique, tactics, physical fitness, mental preparation, medical and biochemical analysis are rarely coordinated in a single program.",
  "about.challenge5.solution": "ATH integrates these aspects into a synergistic system. Coaches, athletic trainers, mental coaches, medical specialists, and nutritionists collaborate on concrete data, developing a shared strategy aligned with your goals.",
  "about.approach.title": "Our Approach",
