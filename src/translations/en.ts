  // About Section
  "about.challenges": "Modern Tennis Challenges and ATH Solutions",
  "about.challenges.subtitle": "Contemporary tennis faces several challenges that limit its evolution and accessibility. ATH has developed specific solutions to overcome them.",
  "about.challenge1.title": "Limited Access to Expertise",
  "about.challenge1.desc": "Only an elite of players have access to high-level programs and coaching. The experience of top coaches is not equally distributed, and it's difficult to follow many athletes without losing quality.",
  "about.solution1.title": "The ATH Solution",
  "about.solution1.desc": "To expand access to elite training, ATH uses digital tools that collect data on technique, tactics, physical state, mental approach, as well as medical and biochemical parameters. Head coaches can thus provide extremely personalized support, optimizing time and resources for the benefit of each athlete.",
  "about.challenge2.title": "Inconsistency in Teaching",
  "about.challenge2.desc": "To compensate for the limitations of the main coaches, other coaches are trained but they create discontinuity in training. This generates inconsistency and hinders the athlete's growth.",
  "about.solution2.title": "The ATH Solution",
  "about.solution2.desc": "We use concrete data from tracking systems, video analysis, athletic tests, mental evaluations, and medical parameters. We organize continuous meetings, supported by AI, to adapt training guidelines to the real needs of each athlete. This ensures consistent and detailed instructions, as happens in the professional field, with performance analysis, personalization of training, and competitive planning.",
  "about.challenge3.title": "Insufficient Analysis",
  "about.challenge3.desc": "A coach, no matter how expert, cannot constantly monitor an athlete if they don't follow them full-time. Their decisions are therefore based on fragmentary and reported information, reducing the accuracy of the analysis.",
  "about.solution3.title": "The ATH Solution",
  "about.solution3.desc": "Our real-time technology captures every detail, including technical, physical, mental, medical, and biochemical aspects. Coaches receive immediate and certain feedback, promoting continuous and measurable improvements.",
  "about.challenge4.title": "Limited Personalization",
  "about.challenge4.desc": "\"Commercial\" solutions often propose a unique method, ignoring individual needs. Those who are not directly followed by the main coach have few opportunities to personalize their path.",
  "about.solution4.title": "The ATH Solution",
  "about.solution4.desc": "With a mix of AI and professional skills, we design tailored training plans. We consider age, physical and mental development, biotype, learning style, goals, and health parameters. In this way, the plan evolves with the athlete's progress, both physical and mental.",
  "about.challenge5.title": "Fragmented Development",
  "about.challenge5.desc": "Technique, tactics, physical form, mental preparation, medical and biochemical analysis are rarely coordinated in a single program.",
  "about.solution5.title": "The ATH Solution",
  "about.solution5.desc": "ATH integrates these aspects into a synergistic system. Coaches, athletic trainers, mental coaches, medical specialists, and nutritionists collaborate on concrete data, developing a shared strategy aligned with your goals.",
  "about.approach.title": "Our Approach",
  "about.approach.desc": "Imagine an environment where every detail of your game is monitored and optimized. ATH is not just a training center, but a new way of teaching and living tennis. Every element of our system responds to the criticalities of modern tennis, offering a complete experience where every aspect works in synergy.",
